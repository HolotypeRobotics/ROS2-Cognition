# ROS2-Cognition
ROS2 nodes for publishing and receiving data in cognition-based robot systems"
# Application
### Server node
 - This node is designed to operate on a server computer, receiving sensory data from a robot's ROS2 node, and sending back control signals to the robot's actuators.
### Client node
 - This node is designed to operate on a rbot controller board, recieving a list of commands for its actuators, and a list of sensors to query. In response it sends the queried sensor data.
